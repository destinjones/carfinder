# Data: what is in `data/`, how it is shaped, where it came from

Every country tab is one JSON file of vehicle rows plus, for the US and India, a table of state tax rules. The files
are plain JSON arrays of arrays (compact, diff-friendly, no keys to misspell). `src/script.html` names the fields in
`US_FIELDS`, `IN_FIELDS` and `G_FIELDS`, and `test/data.test.mjs` enforces everything below.

**Compile date: 29 September 2026.** Prices are the manufacturers' published prices on that day, from brand price lists
and the main listing portal in each country (Autohome and Dongchedi for China; Carwow, What Car? and Autotrader for the
UK; Drive, CarExpert, carsguide and RedBook for Australia; Autocosmos and brand sites for Mexico; km77 and brand tariffs
for Spain; Autospinn and Headlightmag for Thailand; official price lists and Drom/Auto.ru for Russia; Webmotors and
brand launch pricing for Brazil; brand sites, Unhaggle and AutoTrader.ca for Canada; manufacturer sites and EPA
fueleconomy.gov for the US; brand sites and CarDekho/CarWale for India). Rows whose price is announced, expected or
backed out of an all-in price carry `est = 1` and show a *Preliminary* tag.

## One row per nameplate
A row is a model, not a trim: the price range runs from the cheapest variant to the most expensive (options excluded),
and the efficiency figures are for the most efficient common variant, the electric range for the longest-range one, the
power for the most powerful. An EV sold under its own name (Nexon EV, Corolla Cross Hybrid where the country lists it
separately) is its own row; a fuel option sold as a variant is part of the same row (`fuelsStr` = `"Petrol/Hybrid"`).

## Global schema (CN, UK, AU, MX, ES, TH, RU, BR, CA): 20 fields
```
[make, model, body, size, cls, fuelsStr, fuel, price_min, price_max, co2, l100, range_km, kwh, hp, seats, drive, mkt, note, est, isNew]
```
| # | field | rules |

## US schema: 21 fields (`cars_us.json`)
```
[make, model, year, body, size, cls, fuel, msrp, top, dest, city, hwy, mpg, range_mi, mpge, hp, seats, drive, mkt, note, est]
```
`year` is 2025 (leftover), 2026 or 2027 (early arrival). `body` adds `Truck` and `Minivan`; `size` is `Subcompact`
`Compact` `Midsize` `Full-size` `Heavy-duty`; `fuel` is one of `Gas` `Diesel` `Hybrid` `PHEV` `EV` `Hydrogen`. `msrp`
and `top` are the base and top-trim MSRP before the destination charge `dest`. `city`, `hwy`, `mpg` are EPA figures
(`null` for EVs and for heavy trucks, which are not rated); `range_mi` and `mpge` are the EPA electric range and MPGe for
EVs and plug-ins. The L/100 km used for unit companions is derived as 235.215 / mpg.

## India schema: 20 fields (`cars_in.json`)
```
[make, model, body, size, cls, fuelsStr, fuel, price_lakh, top_lakh, gst, kmpl, range_km, kwh, hp, seats, drive, mkt, note, est, isNew]
```
Prices are **ex-showroom in lakh** (3.5 = ₹3,50,000) and are multiplied by 100,000 on load. `gst` is the slab inside the
price (5% EVs, 18% small cars, 40% larger ones, since 22 September 2025). `size` adds `Entry` and `Sub-4m`. `kmpl` is the
ARAI claimed mileage (km per kg for CNG); L/100 km for unit companions is 100 / kmpl.

## State tables
- `states_us.json`: `code → [name, sales tax %, typical dealer doc fee $, note]`, 50 states + DC + `US` (nationwide
  average). Connecticut's 7.75% above $50,000 and South Carolina's $500 cap are special-cased in `usTax()`.
- `states_in.json`: `code → {name, p, d, c, ev, mult, fixed, cap, min, preGst, city, note}`: road-tax slabs by
  price (lakh) for petrol (`p`), diesel (`d`), CNG (`c`) and EVs (`ev`, empty = exempt), a cess multiplier, fixed and
  capped amounts, whether the slab applies to the pre-GST price, and a city surcharge. `BH` is the Bharat series.
- Every other country's regions and rates live in `src/script.html` next to the breakdown function that uses them
  (`REGIONS`, `RU_TAX`, `BR_ST`, `CA_PROV`, `CA_FREIGHT`, the Australian duty formulas, the Mexican ISAN table…), with
  the research behind them in [`docs/tax-notes/`](tax-notes/).

## How the on-road price is estimated
1. **Dealer band.** `BAND[cc][mkt]` gives the share of list a car in that demand level sells for (US `deals`: 87–94%
   of sticker; China `deals`: 70–85%; NEVs in China have their own tighter bands). The band and its reason are shown on
   the card and in the breakdown.
2. **Taxes and fees** for the chosen region are applied to both ends of the band by the country's `bd<CC>()` function.
   Lines marked `info` (insurance in most countries, trade-in subsidies, KASKO, next year's transport tax) are shown
   but not added; lines marked `est` are the estimated ones.
3. **Rebates** that the dealer takes off at purchase (the UK Electric Car Grant, Canada's EVAP and provincial rebates)
   are subtracted; rebates paid afterwards (Spain's Plan Auto+, China's trade-in subsidy) are shown as information.
4. **World tab.** Each car's home on-road price for its default region is converted at the ECB reference rates of
   29 September 2026 (`FX`; rubles at the market rate).

Fuel cost uses the country's default fuel and electricity prices and typical annual distance (`COUNTRIES[cc].assume`,
editable in the app), with a 12% charging-loss factor (25% for CLTC-rated ranges). Monthly payment is a standard
amortised loan on the midpoint of the on-road range with the country's typical rate, term and down payment.

## Adding or fixing rows
Edit the JSON (keep the field order), then `node src/build.js && node --test`. The tests reject a wrong length, an
unknown enum, a range outside the plausible limits, a duplicate make+model, a note with a double quote, and any
car-region combination whose total comes out non-finite or implausible. A pull request with the source of the price in
its description is all it takes.
